# 🎓 Student Record Management System – Java Console Project

Welcome to the **Student Record Management System**, a beginner-to-intermediate level project built using **Core Java**. This console-based application helps manage student records with functionalities to **add**, **view**, **delete**, and **auto-save** data.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add, View, and Delete student records  
✅ Auto-save functionality using **Multithreading** (every 30 seconds)  
✅ Persistent data storage using **File Handling (I/O)**  
✅ Structured with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles  
✅ Uses **ArrayList** from Java Collections for record management  
✅ Handles invalid inputs using **Exception Handling**
